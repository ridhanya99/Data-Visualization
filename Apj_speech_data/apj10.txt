I have seen three dreams which have taken shape as vision, mission and realization. Space programme of ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) particularly from Prof. Brahmprakash, AGNI programme of DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organization) and PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) becoming the National Mission. Of course, these three programmes succeeded in the midst of many challenges and problems. I have worked in all these three areas. I want to convey to you what I have learnt on leadership from these three programmes:
Leader must have a vision. 

b.	Leader must have a passion to transform the vision into action. 

c.	Leader must be able to travel into an unexplored path. 

d.	Leader must know how to manage a success and failure. 

e.	Leader must have courage to take decision. 

f.	Leader should have Nobility in management.

g.	Every action of the leader should be transparent. 

h.	Leader must work with integrity and succeed with integrity. 

For success in all your missions you have to become creative leaders. Creative leadership means exercising the vision to change the traditional role from the commander to the coach, manager to mentor, from director to delegator and from one who demands respect to one who facilitates self-respect. For a prosperous and


developed India, the important thrust will be on the generation of a number of creative leaders from our educational institution. 

Friends, remembering Prof. Brahm Prakash on his Birth Centenary Celebrations, is indeed a great occasion for me to give my reverence and gratitude to the great technologist, the great leader and above all the man of nobility. 

My greetings to all the members of MIDHANI for the success in their mission of promoting science and technology for national development.
